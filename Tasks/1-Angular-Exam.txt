//Answer in English or Arabic ONLY:

1- How to declare a variable in TypeScript?
	- Use the let, const, or var keywords. 
	- variable name.
	- Data type.	
	examples: 
		const name: string = "ahmed"; 
		let age: number = 28;
		var job: string = "developer";  

2-Name the access modifiers supported in TypeScript.
	- public 	- private 	- protected	
	
3-What are import and export keywords in TypeScript?
	-  import and export keywords are used to manage and share code between different files and modules.
	-   import keyword is used to bring external modules, functions, variables, or classes into the current file, making them available for use. 
	-  export keyword is used to make modules, functions, variables, or classes available to other files. It allows you to expose specific members of a module to be imported by other modules.

4-How can a class constant be implemented in TypeScript?


	- class constant can be implemented using the readonly property modifier.



5-How to create objects in Typescript?

	That can be done in several ways:

	- Using Class Instantiation
	- Using Interfaces
	- Using Factory Functions
	- Using Object.create

6-Explain Different Data Types in Typescript?
	
	Primitive Data Types: Basic, immutable, directly represent values (number, string, boolean).
	Non-Primitive Data Types: More complex, can store collections of values, often mutable (array, object, tuple).
	User-Defined Data Types: Custom types created to model complex structures and logic (interface, type alias, union types, intersection types).



7-Explain Tuples in Typescript With Example
	Tuples in TypeScript are a fixed-length array where each element can have a specific type. 
	They offer more flexibility than regular arrays by ensuring type safety for each position within the array.

	// Declare a tuple type
	let person: [string, number];

	// Initialize it
	person = ["Ahmed Rabie Mahmoud", 28]; // Valid initialization

	// Accessing elements
	console.log(person[0]); // Output: Ahmed Rabie Mahmoud
	console.log(person[1]); // Output: 28

8-What are Objects in TypeScript?

	Objects in TypeScript are unordered collections of key-value pairs with optional type annotations for properties.

9-Explain Classes in TypeScript
	Classes in TypeScript provide a blueprint for creating objects with properties and methods, 
	enabling object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

10-What is String Interpolation in Angular?
	String interpolation in Angular is the embedding of expressions within double curly braces ({{ }}) 
	to dynamically display data values from component to template.

11-What is an ngModule?
		It's a class that decorates a module, 
		providing metadata about the module, and is used to:
				Declare a module
				Import and export functionality
				Configure the application
				Provide a way to organize and structure the application
				An NgModule typically consists of:

		Declarations: 
			A list of components, directives, and pipes that belong to the module
			mports: A list of modules that the current module depends on

		Exports:
			 A list of components, directives, and pipes that can be used by other modules
		Providers:
			 A list of services that can be injected into the module

		By using NgModules, you can:
			Break down a large application into smaller, more manageable pieces
			Reuse functionality across the application
			Easily configure and customize the application

12-What are Pipes in Angular? 

	Pipes are a way to transform and format data in your templates.
	Pipes are used in templates to format data, such as:
		Dates and times
		Currencies
		Numbers
		Strings

13-What are Components in Angular?

	In Angular, Components are the building blocks of an application's user interface, representing a 
	single piece of the UI, such as a header, footer, or form, and consisting of a template, class, 
	and metadata that define its structure, behavior, and interactions.

14-What are Directives in Angular?

	Directives in Angular are instructions for your templates, acting like a bridge between the HTML and your application logic. They come in three main types:

	Component Directives: Reusable UI elements with templates, forming the building blocks of your application's interface.
	Attribute Directives: Attach behavior or styles to existing HTML elements using attributes (*ngIf, *ngFor).
	Structural Directives: Modify the DOM structure by adding, removing, or manipulating elements based on conditions (*ngIf, *ngFor).

15-What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?

	web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content
	as users interact with the app, rather than loading multiple pages from a server, 
	providing a smoth and responsive user experience.
